Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part, lies
must be continually protected from collisions with reality. When you tell

can even reconsider certain facts and honestly change your views. And you

What is more important in determining an (individual) organism's phenotype,

  Any developmental biologist knows that this is a meaningless question.
Every aspect of an organism's phenotype is the joint product of its genes
and its environment. To ask which is more important is like asking, Which
is more important in determining the area of a rectangle, the length or the
width? Which is more important in causing a car to run, the engine or the
gasoline? Genes allow the environment to influence the development of
phenotypes.

Sometimes, apparently rational self-interested strategies turn out (as in
the prisoners' dilemma) to be self-defeating. This may look like a defeat
for rationality, but it is not. Rationality is saved by its own
open-endedness. If a strategy of following accepted rules of rationality is
sometimes self-defeating, this is not the end. We revise the rules to take
account of this, so producing a higher-order rationality strategy. This in
turn may fail, but again we go up a level. At whatever level we fail, there
is always the process of standing back and going up a further level.

Nothing in life is certain except death, taxes and the second law of
thermodynamics. All three are processes in which useful or accessible forms
of some quantity, such as energy or money, are transformed into useless,
inaccessible forms of the same quantity. That is not to say that these
three processes don't have fringe benefits: taxes pay for roads and
schools; the second law of thermodynamics drives cars, computers and
metabolism; and death, at the very least, opens up tenured faculty
positions.

We've all bought and enjoyed books called 'Optical Illusions'. We all love
optical illusions. But that's not what they should call the book. They
should call them 'Brain Failures'. Because that what it is: a complete
failure of human perception. All it takes is a few clever sketches and our
brains can't figure it out.

The world around us redounds with opportunities, explodes with
opportunities, which nearly all folk ignore because it would require them
to violate a habit of thought ... I cannot quite comprehend what goes
through people's minds when they repeat the same failed strategy over and
over, but apparently it is an astonishingly rare realization that you can
try something else.

[...] Often I find that the best way to come up with new results is to find
someone who's saying something that seems clearly, manifestly wrong to me,
and then try to think of counterarguments. Wrong people provide a fertile
source of research ideas.

I know of no society in human history that ever suffered because its people
became too desirous of evidence in support of their core beliefs.

I find the Law of Fives to be more and more manifest the harder I look.

Many a man fails as an original thinker simply because his memory is too
good.

The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the
same as the advantages of theft over honest toil. Let us leave them to
others and proceed with our honest toil.

A system for generating ungrounded but mostly true beliefs would be an
oracle, as impossible as a perpetual motion machine.

The story of computers and artificial intelligence (known as AI) resembles
that of flight in air and space. Until recently people dismissed both ideas
as impossible - commonly meaning that they couldn't see how to do them, or
would be upset if they could.
